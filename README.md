Thank you for taking the time to attempt our Python challenge.
We appreciate your time and hope it won't take you too long but still be interesting.
Feedback from your side is very welcome.

* Please use Python3 and any libraries of your choosing
* If necessary write installation instructions
* Create requirements.txt and comment your code sensibly
* Use only the datasets we provided
* Structure your code in re-usable methods

Tackle either one or both tasks depending on your skill level.

## Task 1)

Read and analyse the given datasets (you can pick 3 of your choosing or use all if you're curious).
Check how they are correlated to each other using more than one method of your choosing.
Visualize correlations/clusters/etc.
Describe your thought process.
We don't expect a full fledged model as a result but would like to see your approach, code style, thought process and how far you get. Depending on your skill level the whole process shouldn't take more than 1 hour.
